Raw data, Tabulated data, and Matlab Processing Scripts for ENPH 352 Lab  Lab done in 2017, in the Hebb building. Carried out in October.

main.m will run and produce all outputs and plots needed as long as all of the .mat files and the createfits.m are stored in the same working directory as main.m. The other documents are not nessecary to run the Matlab script, and were used to make figures for the paper portion of the lab. 

Raw data and Tabulated is provided as is, and may not make sense absent the lab manual, and the Matlab script.
